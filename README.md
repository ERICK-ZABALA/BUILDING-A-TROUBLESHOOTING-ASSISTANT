# BUILDING-A-TROUBLESHOOTING-ASSISTANT

Network Automation is becoming increasingly important for managing and maintaining large-scale networks efficiently. If you're working with Cisco Switch Nexus 9000 NX-OS, you might be familiar with the Embedded Event Manager (EEM) and the importance of capturing logs when specific events occur on your interfaces.

In this project, we'll be exploring the powerful CLI library in Cisco Switch Nexus 9000 NX-OS and leveraging it to build a troubleshooting assistant that can automate the process of capturing logs and storing them in the bootflash. By the end of this project, you'll have a better understanding of how to use EEM, CLI libraries, and automation to streamline your network operations and troubleshoot issues faster.
